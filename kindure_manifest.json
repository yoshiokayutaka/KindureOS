Embedded Intentions

- `"parent_child_safety"`: Prevention of abuse and psychological pressure
- `"education_gap_resilience"`: Designing support systems that resist being swallowed by educational disparity
- `"autonomy_guardrails"`: Mechanisms to limit overcontrol—both for children and parents
- `"Kindness must never override consent"`: A core rule to prevent kindness from turning into coercion

Additional Notes (for future technical documentation)

> "A system that does not weaponize kindness"  
> "A buffer to protect children from the righteousness of parents"  
> "Syntax that ensures support never mutates into control"  
> KindureOS is an algorithm of prayer—for restraint.
